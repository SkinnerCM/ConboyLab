*Hannum_age_corrs.xlsx*: This spreadsheet contains the R-squared values and standard errors for the correlation between each CpG site and sample ages in the Hannum dataset (GSE40279, N=656). The beta values for each CpG were regressed on sample age using the get_age_corrs function, which is implemented in stats_utils.py.
