Title	Differential DNA methylation in Multiple Sclerosis
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by array
Summary	Genome-wide DNA methylation level was studied to determine whether multiple sclerosis patients (cases) has methylation differences comparing to normal controls in PBLs.
We used Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation difference in peripheral blood from multiple sclerosis patients (cases) and normal controls
 	
Overall design	Bisulphite converted DNA from the multiple sclerosis patients (cases) and normal controls were hybridized to the Illumina Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
